KSP Instellar Mod for Kerbal Space Program

This version of interstellar is modified and published by me, wavefunctionp. It is not published by FractalUK, the creator of Interstellar. Do not blame him for broke things with this version, instead contact me on the interstellar forum thread, forum pm or email or twitter: @wavefunctionp.

To use this version, download the zip and copy the contents of the GameData folder to your KSP GamaData folder. The rest of the folders are for development and are not needed to play the mod.
